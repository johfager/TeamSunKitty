ADD DIALOG FILES TO THIS FOLDER
	Name them with the character name followed by line id from the script file (case insensitive).
	For Display/Narrator lines, use "NARR" instead of the name.

		Eg: 
		Dave1.wav
		Dave2.wav
		NARR10.wav
		Narr11.wav
		Barney65.wav

	You don't have to use wavs, but unity re-imports them anyway, so if you use ogg/mp3, they'll get compressed again.

IMPORT SETTTINGS:

	I find the import settings that work best are: 

	- Load Type: Decompress On Load
	- Preload Audio Data: Off
	- Compression Format: Vorbis
	- Quality: 50 (probably doesn't matter, but I couldn't hear any audible difference setting this lower)
	- Sample Rate Settings: Optimize Sample Rate
